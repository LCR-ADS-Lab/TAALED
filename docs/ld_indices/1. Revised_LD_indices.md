**[Review] Create a *ldvals object***

All the commands on this page assume that you have created `ldvals` object. The following is the recap for how to creat it using sample text provided in the package.
```python
from taaled import ld #import a package
from pylats import lats #optional
clnsmpl = lats.Normalize(ld.txtsmpl, ld.params) #preprocessing

ldvals = ld.lexdiv(clnsmpl.toks) #calculate LD indices
```

## MTLD<sup>â˜…â˜…â˜…</sup>
The Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD; McCarthy, 2005<sup>[15](https://lcr-ads-lab.github.io/TAALED/references/1.%20Related%20Studies.html#mccarthy-p-m-2005)</sup>; McCarthy & Jarvis, 2010<sup>[17](https://lcr-ads-lab.github.io/TAALED/references/1.%20Related%20Studies.html#mccarthy-p-m--jarvis-s-2010)</sup>) essentially measures the average number of tokens it takes to reach a specified TTR value (i.e., *the point of stabilization* = .720). In short, the number of words required to reach the area prior to the point of stabilization is important. If it requires fewer words, the text is less diverse. There are variants of MTLD implementation.

According to McCarthy and Jarvis (2010)<sup>[17](https://lcr-ads-lab.github.io/TAALED/references/1.%20Related%20Studies.html#mccarthy-p-m--jarvis-s-2010)</sup>, each of the text segments (i.e., the number of tokens) maintaining the TTR values is called a "factor". In MTLD-Original, factors are computed from the beginning to the end of the document using non-overlapping text segments (i.e., subsequent cycles of factor calculation starts at the next token in the text). This is done bidirectionaly (creating two sets of factor lengths). The remaining tokens that do not make up a full factor is called a partial factor, where the factor lengths is adjusted by the following formula: (1 - TTR for the partial factor) / (1 - .720).
**Report MTLD value**

```python
print(ldvals.mtld) # mtld value
```
```result
82.7575
```

**Check MTLDO value**

MTLDO reports the original MTLD as it was explained by McCarthy and Jarvis (2010) in their paper. This approach devide the sum of the factor lengths by the partial factor.
```python
print(ldvals.mtldo) # mtld value as it is described in M & J (2010) paper
```
```result
81.38912039538282
```
**Check MTLDVALS value**

MTLDVALS method returns lengths of each factor used for calculation of the final MTLD score. In the following example, the first two factors were 99 and 74 words in lengths.
```python
print(ldvals.mtldvals)
```
```result
[99.0, 74.0, 77.0, 47.32000000000001, 48.0, 96.0, 103.0, 117.73999999999997]
```
**Check MTLDLISTS value**

MTLDLISTS method reports the list of tokens, factor lengths, and factor proportions used for each calculation. This is for diagnostic purpose.
```python
print(ldvals.mtldlists)
```

**Plot MTLD**
```python
print(ldvals.mtldplot)

## MATTR<sup>â˜…â˜…â˜…</sup>
The Moving-Average Type-Token Ratio calculates the moving average for all segments of a given length. For a segment length of 50 tokens (i.e., window length), TTR is calculated on tokens 1-50, 2-51, 3-52, etc., and the resulting TTR measurements are averaged to produce the final MATTR value (Covington & McFall, 2010<sup>[3](https://lcr-ads-lab.github.io/TAALED/references/1.%20Related%20Studies.html#covington-m-a--mcfall-j-d-2010)</sup>).

## HD-D<sup>â˜…â˜…â˜†</sup>

HD-D (Hypergeometric Distribution Diversity) is a revised index of vocd-D (for more information about vocd-D, see McCarthy & Jarvis, 2007<sup>[16](https://lcr-ads-lab.github.io/TAALED/references/1.%20Related%20Studies.html#mccarthy-p-m--jarvis-s-2007)</sup>). For each word type in a text, HD-D uses the hypergeometric distribution to calculate the probability of encountering one of its tokens in a random sample of 42 tokens, and these probabilities are then added together to produce the final value for the text.

Maas' index is a more complex transformation of TTR that attempts to fit the value to a logarithmic curve. It is often referred to simply as *Maas* (Maas, 1972<sup>[13](https://lcr-ads-lab.github.io/TAALED/references/1.%20Related%20Studies.html#maas-h-d-1972)</sup>).

##### Previous studies with L1 corpus
* Observing that vocd-D(Malvern & Richards, 1997<sup>[12](https://lcr-ads-lab.github.io/TAALED/references/1.%20Related%20Studies.html#malvern-d--richards-b-2002)</sup>) was rapidly becoming the preferred LD measures in the field, McCarthy and Jarvis (2007)<sup>[16](https://lcr-ads-lab.github.io/TAALED/references/1.%20Related%20Studies.html#mccarthy-p-m--jarvis-s-2007)</sup> conducted an assessment of its sensitivity to text length using a corpus of 23 genres taken from various corpora. As a result, they concluded that vocd-D scores were not as independent of text length. In contrast, they found a small relationship (*r*=.282) between text length and HD-D for longer texts (up to 2000 words).

* McCarthy and Jarvis (2010)<sup>[17](https://lcr-ads-lab.github.io/TAALED/references/1.%20Related%20Studies.html#mccarthy-p-m--jarvis-s-2010)</sup> used 16 different written and spoken L1 corpus (comprising texts from a range of registers such as editorials, official documents, academic prose, fiction, etc.). The results suggested that MTLD was stable to the text length (*r*=.016, *p*=.530) whereas other revised indices were fairly correlated to the text length (HD-D: *r*=.282, *p*<.001; Mass: *r*=.125, *p*<.001) and the TTR was extremely correlated (*r*=.811, *p*<.001). They also found that MTLD had a low correlation with the simple TTR, which can be a desirable property of a lexical diversity index since the simple TTR strongly correlates with text length. Meanwhile, they showed that Maas was one of the main predictors of their register prediction model (along with MTLD and vocd-D).

##### Previous studies with L2 spoken corpus
* Koizumi (2012)<sup>[9](https://lcr-ads-lab.github.io/TAALED/references/1.%20Related%20Studies.html#koizumi-r-2012)</sup> evaluated MTLD (including simple TTR, Root TTR, and vocd-D) using spoken English samples from 20 Japanese adolescents. Each text was clipped to the first 200 words and then subdivided into 25 segments ranging in length from 50 to 200 tokens by parallel sampling. Results indicated that MTLD values stabilized at roughly 100 tokens, and none of the other indices produced stable values within the text length ranges included in the study.

* Koizumi and Inâ€™nami (2012)<sup>[10](https://lcr-ads-lab.github.io/TAALED/references/1.%20Related%20Studies.html#koizumi-r--innami-y-2012)</sup> continued the same study after including more participants (38 Japanese teenagers). They reconfirmed the result of the previous research in that MTLD was the only index that yields stable values, with a stabilization point of around 100 words. They found that HD-D was less affected by text length than other commonly used indices, while still reporting meaningful and significant effects.

##### A previous study with L2 written corpus
* Zenker and Kyle (2021)<sup>[20](https://lcr-ads-lab.github.io/TAALED/references/1.%20Related%20Studies.html#zenker-f--kyle-k-2021)</sup> evaluated MTLD using 4,542 argumentative essays by English learners from Asian regions. The result indicated that MTLD-Original and MTLD-MA-Wrap were robust to even shorter texts such as 50 words. They found a negligible relationship (*r*=.064) between HD-D and text length.

##### A previous study on validating LD indices
* Kyle et al. (2021)<sup>[11](https://lcr-ads-lab.github.io/TAALED/references/1.%20Related%20Studies.html#kyle-k-crossley-s-a--jarvis-s-2021)</sup> explored the relationship between the indices and human ratings of LD in both L1 and L2 argumentative essays. The major finding was that the abundance (i.e., the total number of word types) was the strongest predictor of lexical diversity ratings followed by volume (i.e., the total number of word tokens) and variety, which was measured by four LD indices of HD-D, MATTR, MTLD, and MTLD-BI-Wrap. Among the indices, HD-D showed the strongest correlation with human judgments of the LD (*r*=.602, *p*<.001). Considering the correlation between abundance and volume as a potential problem in measuring large and complex constructs in writing assessment, the researchers concluded that measuring the dimension of variety with relatively text length independent indices is critical in L2 assessment.
