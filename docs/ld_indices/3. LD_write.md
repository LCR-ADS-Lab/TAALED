# Batch Processing and Writing Results to a File

The **LD write function** allows you to save your analysis into a *txt* file. Another major (arguably more important) feature of this function is that it also batch processes multiple input text files. Given these characteristics, this function becomes very handy in many use cases.
The following sections describe how to use this function.

## 1. Import necessary packages
```python
from taaled import ld
from pylats import lats

#for creating an output filename
from datetime import datetime 
from datetime import date

#for finding a list of texts
import glob
```

## 2. Get a list of corpus files

For the analysis, we are going to use the sample essays from [the Gachon Learner Corpus 2.1](http://koreanlearnercorpusblog.blogspot.com/p/corpus.html) (Carlstrom & Price, 2014). 
We will use the text file version of the corpus distributed at the linked page.  

```python
#set a path to the folder where your corpus located in
corp_path = "/Users/Unknown/Documents/TAALED/Corpus/sample" 

#get a list of filenames from the folder (need to tweak depending on your filenames)
files = glob.glob(corp_path + "/*.txt")

#(optional) check the number of the files in your folder
len(files) #16111
```

## 3. Define a file-naming function
The following is a helper function to define the filename for your output. This is not absolutely necessary, but our experience suggest that having timestamps on the output files will help enhance the transparency and replicability of analyses (because we might change a small details which might make the output different at different points in the project.).

```python
def outname_creator(fldname,isprll,other = None):
	day = date.today().strftime("%Y%m%d") #get date
	time = datetime.now().strftime("%H%M%S")
	ldv = "taaledv" + ld.version
	latsv = "pylatsv" + lats.version
	if isprll == True: # we are going to think about only the "nopa" option in this tutorial.
		pa = "pa"
	else:
		pa = "nopa"

	if other == None:
		outn = "_".join([day,time,fldname,pa]) + ".txt"
	else:
		outn = "_".join([day,time,fldname,pa,other]) + ".txt"

	return(outn)
	
	
outname = outname_creator("sample",False)	
```

## 4. Make an output file

You can run the `ld.ldwrite` function without parallel analysis (this is typical).
```python
#an output filename should be "date_time_sample_nopa(no parallel analysis).txt"
ld.ldwrite(files,outname)
```

## 5. Examples of the output files

>The name of the file is "20220328_002547_sample_nopa.txt"

>If you want to do further (statistical) analysis with the calculated values, we can copy the output to other program (e.g., Excel). Alternatively, some statistical programs can directly import this tab delimited file.
