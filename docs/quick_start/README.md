# Quick start guides
This page should explain minimal flow of package usage. 

## Installation

To install taaled, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install taaled
```
While not strictly necessary, this tutorial will presume that you have also installed [pylats](https://github.com/LCR-ADS-Lab/pylats) and [spacy](https://spacy.io/) for text preprocessing.

taaled also makes use of [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) for data visualization. This package is not required for taaled to function properly, but is needed if data visualization (e.g., density plots for mtld factor lengths) are desired.
